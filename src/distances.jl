    AbstractDistance

Distance function used to evaluate the distance from a point to a set.
New subtypes of `AbstractDistance` must implement fallbacks for sets they don't cover and implement
`distance_to_set(::Distance, v, s::S)` for sets they override the distance for.

Default distance function, uses the Euclidean distance.

    distance_to_set(distance_definition, v, s)

Compute the distance of a value to a set.
When `v âˆˆ s`, the distance is zero (or all individual distances are zero).

Each set `S` implements at least `distance_to_set(d::DefaultDistance, v::T, s::S)`
with `T` of appropriate type for members of the set.
